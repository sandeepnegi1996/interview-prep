# equals and ==

## == 
in case of primitive type == is similar to comparing values it will give true or false based on the values

## Equals
 equals in case of object comparison will basically use the original definition which is there in the Parent Object Class
 and according to this defition it will just compare the memory location
 and to use it compare two objects we need to override this method inside our class and give the implementaion


## == 
in String it will compare whether the string reference varibale is pointing to the same value or not 
if it is pointing to the same value
