# Recursion

It has two things 
1. edge condition 
2. recursive approach

### working

1. it will divide the problem into sub problems and solution from one problem will be input for other


##### Questions
1. factorial:- factorial of  n=n*fact(n-1)*
so edge condition will be factorial of zero is one and factorial of 1 is one. other than this we will call the factorial for n*fact(n-1)*

2. String reverse :
